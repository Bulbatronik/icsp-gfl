selection_method: gradients # Gradient-based neighbor selection using cosine similarity of model updates
selection_ratio: 0.5 # Ratio of neighbors selected based on gradient similarity
dist: cosine # Not used for gradients method (gradient similarity is computed via cosine)
num_eig: 3 # Not used for gradients method
t: 40 # Not used for gradients method
tau: 1 # Temperature for softmax over gradient similarities (lower = more selective)
